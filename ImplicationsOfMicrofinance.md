### Info: How do we read a Stata File in R?

**read_dta** reads a file in Stata version 5-12 binary format into a data frame in R. This funtion only supports Stata formats after 12, but since we have a 5-12 format it can be used.


```r
library(haven)
stata_data <- read_dta("~/Documents/GitHub/thesis_code_rep/kz_demandelasts_aer08.dta")
```
